# Robot Camera Commissioning Tool

This project provides a Python-based command-line tool to configure scanning cameras installed on warehouse robots.
The tool reads a list of serial numbers from a JSON file, asks the user for camera type, and sends a formatted configuration payload to a local test API.

---

## Features

- Interactive CLI for selecting camera type and loading camera serial numbers
- Constructs a valid API configuration based on provided camera type
- Sends a `PUT` request to a mock server endpoint to simulate robot configuration
- Includes automated unit testing for key functionality

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Standard libraries only: `json`, `requests`, `http.server`, `unittest`, etc.

---

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Mock Server

In terminal 1:

```bash
python server.py
```

> This starts a server at `http://localhost:8888/api/v1/config/cameras`

### 2. Run the CLI Tool

In terminal 2:

```bash
python Task2_Commision_tool.py
```

Follow the prompt to:

- Select camera type (TYPE_A or TYPE_B)
- Enter the path to the serial number file (e.g. `serial_numbers.json`)

If successful, you’ll see:

```bash
Cameras successfully configured!
```

## Run Unit Tests

To validate logic and API structure, use:

```bash
python Unit_Testing.py
```

Expected output:

```bash
Test build_configuration: PASS
.Test invalid_format: PASS
.Test missing_file: PASS
.Test valid_serials: PASS
.Error: 400
Bad request
Test send_failure: PASS
.Cameras successfully configured!
Test send_success: PASS

## Example JSON Input

`serial_numbers.json`:

```json
{
  "A": "DA2352466",
  "B": "DA2352453",
  "C": "DA2352580",
  "D": "DA2471547"
}
```

## API Details

- Method: `PUT`
- Endpoint: `/api/v1/config/cameras`
- Content-Type: `application/json`
- Success Response: `204 No Content`

---

## Notes

- Ensure the mock server is running before executing the CLI tool
- IDs and serial numbers must be unique or the server will reject the request
